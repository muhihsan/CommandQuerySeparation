# CommandQuerySeparation

This is a very interesting pattern by [Steven](https://stackoverflow.com/users/264697/steven), in his [blog](https://cuttingedge.it/blogs/steven/pivot/entry.php?id=92).

This repository contains the implementation of that pattern in .NET Core.

Also thanks to [Willie](https://medium.com/@willie.tetlow/net-core-dependency-injection-decorator-workaround-664cd3ec1246) for the idea to add decorator to the query.
